# Overall Journey (2016 - 2025)

I began my programming journey with a passion for solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions. From the beginning, I explored diverse technologies—from traditional desktop applications to cutting-edge AI systems—never limiting myself to one stack or domain. I worked on both academic research projects and practical applications, always aiming to deliver maintainable, impactful solutions that push technological boundaries.

In the early years (2016-2019), I focused on building strong foundations through academic projects and research. I explored object-oriented programming, database systems, machine learning research, and real-time communication systems. This period deepened my understanding of core computer science principles while giving me the confidence to tackle increasingly complex challenges.

By 2022, I had evolved into modern web development, embracing full-stack architectures with TypeScript, enterprise-grade authentication systems, and cloud deployment pipelines. I began contributing to the open-source community with production-ready boilerplates and templates that other developers could build upon.

Throughout 2024-2025, I focused on cutting-edge innovations—pioneering browser-based AI applications, creating privacy-first solutions, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web browsers. I've contributed tools that democratize AI access, educational platforms that share knowledge openly, and productivity applications that solve real-world problems.

Throughout each stage of this journey, I have stayed true to core principles: learn continuously, share knowledge openly through open-source contributions, and focus on creating solutions that drive real technological impact. Every project has become an opportunity to explore new technologies, contribute to the developer community, and push both technical and creative boundaries.
