# Overall Journey (2019 - 2025)

I started my career as a Software Engineer, always eager to take on challenges and work across different technologies. From the beginning, I explored a wide range of projects—ERP systems, mobile apps, MVPs, Shopify stores, LMS platforms, and more—never limiting myself to one stack or domain. I worked on both legacy systems and greenfield projects, always aiming to deliver maintainable, business-driven solutions.

In 2022, I grew into the role of Senior Software Engineer. Here, I focused on designing scalable architectures, leading requirement analysis, and guiding teams through complex projects. I had the opportunity to contribute to impactful solutions—such as travel platforms, educational systems, and government reporting tools—while also helping to define stronger engineering standards within the team. This stage deepened my technical expertise and strengthened my ability to align solutions with real business needs.

By 2024, I had advanced to Lead Software Engineer, where my responsibilities expanded to both technical leadership and mentorship. I guided multiple high-impact projects from concept to production, delivering platforms that scaled to 200k+ users, with some serving over 80k monthly active users. I introduced automation pipelines, CI/CD workflows, and productivity tools that became part of the team’s culture. Alongside project delivery, I trained interns, mentored juniors, conducted technical sessions, and shared insights through blogs and presentations—investing in both people and processes.

Throughout each stage of my career, I have stayed true to a few principles: learn continuously, share knowledge openly, and focus on creating solutions that drive real impact. Mistakes became opportunities to improve, teammates became partners in growth, and every project became a chance to push both technical and human boundaries.
